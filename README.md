This is a repository containing Monte Carlo simulation code for a Master's Degree thesis in Data Science authored by Simone Di Gregorio, focused on statistical estimation for stochastic differential equations.
The code specifically focuses on testing the oracle inequality from [Koike and Oga (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304414923002120), 
specifying a generalization risk bound on neural network drift estimators based on difference quotients.
