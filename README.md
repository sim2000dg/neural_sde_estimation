This is a repository containing Monte Carlo simulation code for the paper _Neural Drift Estimation for Ergodic Diffusions: Non-parametric Analysis and Numerical Exploration_ (S. Di Gregorio, F. Iafrate, _New Trends in Functional Statistics and Related Fields_, 2025).
The code specifically focuses on testing the oracle inequality from [Koike and Oga (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304414923002120), 
specifying a generalization risk bound on neural network drift estimators based on difference quotients.
